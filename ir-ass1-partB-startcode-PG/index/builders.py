"""Unified index package builder for Task 1.

Build one on-disk package containing:
- ``unified``: term -> document frequency and per-document term frequency
- ``wildcard``: character n-gram -> sorted vocabulary terms
- ``proximity``: term -> {doc_id -> sorted positions}

Tokens are already cleaned before they reach this function. Use them as-is.
